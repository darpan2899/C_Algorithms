# C_Algorithms
This repository contains c programs demonstrating implementation of various Sorting and Dynamic programming algorithms.
All the programs were implemented by me as an approach to understand their functioning.
Also calculated time complexity of various sorting and searching algorithms and compared them to determine most efficient algorithm out of them particularly.
